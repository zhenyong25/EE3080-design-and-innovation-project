The Espdrone PC client enables flashing and controlling the Espdrone. It implements the user interface and high-level control (for example gamepad handling). The communication with Espdrone and the implementation of the CRTP protocol to control the Crazflie is handled by the [edlib project](https://github.com/bitcraze/espdrone-lib-python).
