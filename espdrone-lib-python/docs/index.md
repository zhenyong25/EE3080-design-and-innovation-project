edlib is an API written in Python that is used to communicate with the Espdrone
and Espdrone 2.0 quadcopters. It is intended to be used by client software to
communicate with and control a Espdrone quadcopter. For instance the [Espdrone PC client](https://github.com/bitcraze/espdrone-clients-python)  uses the edlib.
