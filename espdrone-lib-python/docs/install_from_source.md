### Developing for the edclient
* [Fork the edlib](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
* [Clone the edlib](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/espdrone-lib-python.git`
* [Install the edlib in editable mode](http://pip-python3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html?highlight=editable#editable-installs), `pip install -e path/to/edlib` 


* [Uninstall the edlib if you don't want it any more](http://pip-python3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/pip_uninstall.html), `pip uninstall edlib`

Note: If you are developing for the [edclient][edclient] you must use python3. On Ubuntu (16.04, 18.08) use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

### Linux, OSX, Windows

The following should be executed in the root of the espdrone-lib-python file tree.

#### Virtualenv
This section contains a very short description of how to use [virtualenv (local python environment)](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) 
with package dependencies. If you don't want to use virualenv and don't mind installing edlib dependencies system-wide
you can skip this section.

* Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`
* create an environment: `virtualenv venv`
* Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`


* To deactivate the virtualenv when you are done using it `deactivate`

Note: For systems that support [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Simple-Makefile.html), you can use `make venv` to
create an environment, activate it and install dependencies.

#### Install edlib dependencies
Install dependencies required by the lib: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To verify the installation, connect the espdrone and run an example: `python examples/basiclog`
